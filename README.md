Projects done by Collins.

The first project is on Natural Language for a computer based product reviews.
I carried it out during my datascience program with world Quant University(WQU).The second is a project on sentiment analysis of reviews I recieved from an app we developed. While the third is a function for investment advice.It was developed during my MSc. program in Finacial Engenering with WQU. Its to help investors make an informed decision when choosing stocks to buy.With it they can copare stock and know which is less volatile with high returns.
