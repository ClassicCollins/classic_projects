Projects done by Collins.

The first project(twitter_disaster_prediction) is on prediction of tweets that are real disaster or not. The data was provided by Kaggle.Train and test datasets are attached as train and test csv files. The result of my prediction is in submission file. 

The second is a project(sentiment_analysis_of_CollinsApp) on sentiment analysis of reviews, I recieved from an app we developed. An extract from the review was used for this analysis. The aim is to get the total number of positive and negative comments as well as generate positive and negative comments from the reviews.

While the third is an investment advicer(CompareStocks).It was developed during my MSc. program in Finacial Engineering with WQU. It's to help investors make an informed decision when choosing stocks to buy.It will help investors compare stock and know which is less volatile with high returns(best stock to buy).The data is based on past historical data from yahoo Finance and does not guarantee it will continue to be like this in the future.

Thanks for checking it out. Your contributions and suggestions will be deeply appreciated.
